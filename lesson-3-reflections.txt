When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	I would create a remote repository when I reach a good quality state of my work, 
	and I want to share it with others. So, I have to push my branch on github so 
	others can pull it and check it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This is because I want to keep my commits organized, and not to clutter others
	commits with my commits.

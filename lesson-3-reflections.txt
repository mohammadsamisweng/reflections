When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	I would create a remote repository when I reach a good quality state of my work, 
	and I want to share it with others. So, I have to push my branch on github so 
	others can pull it and check it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This is because I want to keep my commits organized, and not to clutter others
	commits with my commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	We use forking when we want to get a copy of someone else repository and 
	place the new copy on GitHub servers. In this way we can have our own copy
	without modifying the original repo, and at the same time we can suggest 
	modifications to the original repository. Clones can be used to get a copy 
	of a repository to our local machine. The source can be either a repository
	on GitHub or another local repository. Branches is a way of labeling certain
	commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	Sometimes the local master branch may not into sync with the github master
	branch, and that they are out of sync. So, the only way to solve this issue
	is to have another copy of the remote branch, and then we can merge it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	Without GitHub, it will be very tedious to collaborate. One of the ways is 
	to share the project through email for example, or exchanging a flash memory.
	In this way, if we exchange many time, then we will almost lose which one
	comes before the other. Using GitHub, it may contains more step, but on the 
	long run, it is much more efficient.
